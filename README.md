# Rates of Reaction simulation

This project is to create a rates of reaction simulation for use with my DP Chemistry students (Topic 5 - Kinetics & Topic 6 - Equilibrium)

## The end goal:
+ A simple version which relies on dice rolls
+ A more advanced version which pulls in Chemistry kinetics
+ An equilibrium version which demonstrates two opposing rates 

### Details / To-do
+ Chart to be provided by chart.js (see https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)
+ Initial goal --> simple page allowing number of particles, dice size, target number and number of rounds to be changed + run button + graph / table
