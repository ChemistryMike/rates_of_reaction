## Rates of Reaction simulation

This project is to create a rates of reaction simulation for use with my DP Chemistry students (Topic 5 - Kinetics & Topic 6 - Equilibrium)

# The end goal:
+ A simple version which relies on dice rolls
+ A more advanced version which pulls in Chemistry kinetics
+ An equilibrium version which demonstrates two opposing rates
